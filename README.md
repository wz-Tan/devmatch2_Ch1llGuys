# QuestismOS – Ranked Gamified NFTs Marketplace with zkLogin to better bridge Web2 to Web3.

## 🏆 Overview

**QuestismOS** is a **gamified NFT marketplace** built on **Sui** that allows NFTs to **level up or rank up** when completing certain quests or tasks.  
Our mission is to create a **better bridge from Web2 to Web3**, making blockchain accessible, rewarding, and fun.

Players and collectors can **buy, sell, auction, and interact** with NFTs that evolve dynamically over time — creating a sense of progression like in gaming.  
We also implement **zkLogin** for seamless onboarding and **dynamic NFT fields** to support special items, seasonal promotions, and rewards for active buyers.
